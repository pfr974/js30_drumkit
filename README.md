# Javascript project 1: Drum Kit

To start the month, I am following the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos. This is a **free** course that give you access to 30 vanilla JavaScript projects. As I was following my Javascript course, I had some issues with seeing how it works so I decided to look for some projects.
